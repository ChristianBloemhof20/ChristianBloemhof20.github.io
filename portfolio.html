            <h2 class="project_name">Pangeo</h2>
            <p>Pangeo is the name of a game that I created with a team of 4 other students. Pangeo is a tower defense hybrid game, where the twist of the game is that towers will break after a certain period of time. Players must play minigames to fix the towers or to give the towers boosts to fend off the waves of enemies. The game is called Pangeo because our narrative is about a land called Pangeo where all the different countries are made up by different shapes. The main characters are the Spheres, and since their technology is better, because they're so well rounded, everyone else wants to raid them and steal their technology. The player must take control of a general in the Spheres' army and defend their homeland using tower defense. To play Pangeo, you can go to this link: <a href="https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-127103" target="_blank">Pangeo</a></p>

            <h2 class="project_name">Your Fate</h2>
            <p>Your Fate is a browser game that I created for the itch.io Mini Jam 96: Fate. This was a game jam that took place over the span of 3 days that the user had to create a game with the theme of fate. Your Fate is a game where the player uses the mouse to control a cursor and run away from an enemy that is constantly chasing. The player begins the game by waking up in the dungeon of the enemy and has to run away from being captured for as long as possible. However, this is an endless game, meaning that the fate of the player is always to be eventually captured.

        <div class="project">
            <h2 class = "project_name">Twitter Bot</h2>
            <p>In this project, I created a bot that would grab     data from a database on my personal device, log onto    twitter, tweet that data, then log out.  This project  was done using the Selenium library in Python.  Check    out the code on my github <a href="https://github.com/ChristianBloemhof20/TwitterBot" target="_blank">TwitterBot</a>.  The     database on my personal device that the bot accesses    was created using SQL. This process is automated, in   the video I manually start up the program for video   purposes but in actuality the program runs on its own.    The way that I did this was by converting the .py file    to a .exec file and setting a time on my calendar to   open that .exec file twice a week.</p>
