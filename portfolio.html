                    <p>OdinXR is a startup out of Cal Poly and I was the cofounder that handled all aspects of
                        programming. In 2020, we as students recognized the need for better, more accessible online
                        engineering labs. To solve this issue, we utilized virtual reality to create engineering labs
                        that would be just as hands on as real labs would be. This is our first lab, the electrical
                        engineering lab. This was created mainly by me and in the video below I highlight some of the
                        features that I implemented. This was created using the Unity game engine.</p>

                    <p>In October of 2021, the Cal Poly Cybersecurity Institute hired me to develop thier virtual
                        reality police training. This training would mimic an investigation into an illicit massage
                        parlor that is conducting human trafficking and needed to be a realistic experience. This was a
                        project in progress with a team that I joined on midway through its lifespan. I was in charge of
                        environment building, dialog, plot, creation of characters, results, and more. This project was
                        created using the Unity game engine.</p>

                    <h2 class="project_name">Pangeo</h2>
                    <p>Pangeo is the name of a game that I created with a team of 4 other students. Pangeo is a tower
                        defense hybrid game, where the twist of the game is that towers will break after a certain
                        period of time. Players must play minigames to fix the towers or to give the towers boosts to
                        fend off the waves of enemies. The game is called Pangeo because our narrative is about a land
                        called Pangeo where all the different countries are made up by different shapes. The main
                        characters are the Spheres, and since their technology is better, because they're so well
                        rounded, everyone else wants to raid them and steal their technology. The player must take
                        control of a general in the Spheres' army and defend their homeland using tower defense. To play
                        Pangeo, you can go to this link: <a href="https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-127103"

                    <h2 class="project_name">Your Fate</h2>
                    <p>Your Fate is a browser game that I created for the itch.io Mini Jam 96: Fate. This was a game jam
                        that took place over the span of 3 days that the user had to create a game with the theme of
                        fate. Your Fate is a game where the player uses the mouse to control a cursor and run away from
                        an enemy that is constantly chasing. The player begins the game by waking up in the dungeon of
                        the enemy and has to run away from being captured for as long as possible. However, this is an
                        endless game, meaning that the fate of the player is always to be eventually captured, meaning
                        that the players demise was their fate. Play Your Fate at this link: <a
                            href="https://christianbloemhof.itch.io/your-fate" target="_blank">Your Fate</a></p>
                    <p>I learned a lot from this game jam and got a lot of positive feedback on the music and feel of
                        the game. One of the things I plan on doing in the future is going back and creating a game
                        similar to Your Fate but with my improved skills.</p>

                    <h2 class="project_name">Twitter Bot</h2>
                    <p>In this project, I created a bot that would grab data from a database on my personal device, log
                        onto twitter, tweet that data, then log out. This project was done using the Selenium library in
                        Python. Check out the code on my github <a
                            href="https://github.com/ChristianBloemhof20/TwitterBot" target="_blank">TwitterBot</a>. The
                        database on my personal device that the bot accesses was created using SQL. This process is
                        automated, in the video I manually start up the program for video purposes but in actuality the
                        program runs on its own. The way that I did this was by converting the .py file to a .exec file
                        and setting a time on my calendar to open that .exec file twice a week.</p>
