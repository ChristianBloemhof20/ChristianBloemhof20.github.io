        My name is Christian Bloemhof, I am currently a fifth year Computer
        Engineering major at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. I enjoy going out with
        my friends, playing sports and video games, and being competitive. If I
        was to give you a short description of who I am, it would be a quote
        from my cross country coach in high school, "Christian, you're the type
        of person to run head first into a problem. You don't care about how big
        or tough it is, you aren't intimidated." If you want to know more about
        who I am, check out my
        <a href="aboutMe.html" target="_blank">About Me</a> page.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of my skills are with Unity, Python, C, and Java. These are not my
        only technical skills, I have quite a few more programs and languages
        that I know how to use and that list is growning daily. If you'd like to
        see some of my skills in action, head over to my
        <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> page. I am currently looking for
        a job for when I graduate in June 2022. I am currently the CTO of a
        startup called OdinXR and also a Unity intern at the Cal Poly Cyber
        Institute, you can find more detailed descriptions of these on my
        <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> page.
