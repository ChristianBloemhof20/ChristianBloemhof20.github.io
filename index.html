        <p>My name is Christian     Bloemhof, I am currently a   fourth year     Computer  Engineering major at Cal Poly,   San Luis Obispo.  Some things I   enjoy doing are being social  with my friends, playing music   playing/watching sports, and  being independent.  If I was to  give you a short  description of     who I am, it would be a quote   from my cross country coach in    high school, "Christian, you're    the type of person to run head     first into a problem.  You don't    care about how big or tough it     is, you aren't    intimidated."     If you want to know more about  who I am, check out my <a    href="aboutMe.html"    target="_blank">About Me</a>   page.</p>

        <p> A few of my skills are with     the coding languages of Python,     Java, and HTML. However, these  are only some of the languages I     know. I have many more skills I     would love to show that you can     find on my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> page. I am currently looking for an  internship for Summer of 2021. I have not had an internship before so I am open to any kind of job, from fullstack to security I am  willing to learn and discover what I enjoy.</p>
