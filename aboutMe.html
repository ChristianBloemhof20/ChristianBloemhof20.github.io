            Welcome to my about me page. Here, I will talk about who I am, what I'm looking for, my experience, and then some personal details about my life. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I graduated with a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in June 2022. I am currently seeking a job in any programming field, with a desire to go into game development. In the last year I have learned a lot about game development: from the startup that I'm a part of, classes I've taken, and an internship I'm working while in school. While this is my desired career path, I am also very interested in any job that involves programming as I have grown to greatly enjoy programming through the years.

            In Spring 2021, I was searching for a summer internship. While looking, I stumbled upon   <a href="https://www.odinxr.com/">OdinXR</a>, a startup out of Cal Poly. After learning about their mission statement, I sent in my application and ended up getting the position as an intern on their team. That summer, I worked with a team of 4 other software interns as we created an environment in Unity that would be used for college level electrical engineering virtual reality courses. At the end of the summer, I was offered a leadership role at OdinXR and to this day I am the head software developer. Through the following school year, I continued to work on software for the startup as it became one of my senior projects.

            In Fall 2021, I began looking for a part time job to make some cash while continuing my studies. This is when I discovered an opening for a Unity Developer Intern at the Cal Poly Cyber Institute. After applying, I also got this position. This internship was a very different experience than OdinXR. While there were some similarities, such as programming with Unity and C# for a virtual reality experience, the experience was different because I began working on a project that many other people had already worked on. Instead of starting at the beginning of a project, I had to learn how to integrate into an existing system.

            My dream job is to be a game developer. My whole life, I have wanted to make video games. When I became a Computer Engineering major, one of my first thoughts was that this could now happen. Although this dream was lost for a bit when I was learning all the basics of programming, as an experienced programmer being able to come back and begin to learn something I'm extremely passionate about is a dream come true. My goal in this industry is to be the head developer on a game that makes it to the front page of all the game stores. I have a lot of creative ideas and stories I want to tell through the narrative of video games and I hope that I can get the opportunity to do that someday.

            Now that I have known the basics of programming for a few years, I have gotten great enjoyment from learning new skills and topics. In the Summer of 2020, when COVID had shut the world down, I spent my time learning new coding skills. Skills such as teaching myself HTML and CSS and programming this whole webpage. Or skills like learning new Python libraries to open a chrome tab, log into Twitter, and utilize a SQL database to grab and tweet data. Certain topics, such as computer networks, fascinated me so much that I became a TA for the Cal Poly Computer Networks lab to just get inside of the lab.

        <h1>Personal Life</h1>

            Outside of work and academics, I have a few personal hobbies and interests. My first would be sports, ever since I was a kid I've been involved in whatever sport was available. I usually sucked at these sports, but as I got older I began to get better at them. In high school, my main sports were cross country, basketball, and track. I made lots of friends doing them and still enjoy running and playing basketball to this day.

            Another large part of my life is music.  I don't just mean listening to music, although I do love doing that, I mean playing music.  I've been playing piano ever since 4th grade, and in college I continue to play for myself and for my church.  I can also play saxophone, ukelele, guitar, drums, and maybe a few others that slip my mind but piano is my main thing.  I also really enjoy singing, but don't ask me to sing because I'm not very good at it.  I just believe that everyone should be unashamed to sing poorly because singing is incredibly fun.

            This was a brief summary of who I am, there are many stories, experiences, and times that I'm not able to fit in a single page of a website. If you wish to contact me, you can reach me at ChristianGBloemhof@gmail.com.
