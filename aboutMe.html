            Hello, welcome to my about me page.  Here I'm going to talk more about myself and less about my skills, projects, and accomplishments so if you're looking for those please make your way to my <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently a 4th year computer engineering major at Cal Poly SLO.  I will be going to school for 5 years, so I am currently looking for an internship for Summer 2020.  In school, I have learned how to program in multiple languages, meet standards for coding, and to push myself and learn to understand computers on a deeper level than most people.  While learning in school is nice, I have also taken the time outside of class to learn how to do more.  This includes, but is not limited to, SQL, HTML & CSS, and various Python libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
            In all honesty, I do not know what exactly I want to do in the field of computer science.  I believe this is fair though, with my lack of experience in the field there is no way for me to know what I like or not.  What I really want at this point is experience, I really desire to be plugged in and connect with people who are in my desired field.

            Here are some things that I've learned that most organizations would like to know when searching for applications.  First, I built this website all on my own.  I did not know HTML before building this website, I had to take the time to search for resources online and learn on my own.  Secondly, I know all the important data structures and things similar.  Arrays, linked lists, hash tables, objects, trees, queues, stacks, I have a good understanding of all these things.  Lastly, I know how to use most languages.  I'm familiar with: 
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>C</li>
                <li>Assembly</li>
                <li>SQL</li>
                <li>HTML & CSS</li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
        <p>
            The big thing I want to do is grow.  What's the point of an internship if I don't learn anything?  What's the point of going to school and attending these classes if I'm not paying attention?  What's the point of doing any of this if I don't enjoy it or intend to grow?  I truly am passionate for this field and I can promise that whatever I do, I will put my absolute 110% best effort into.

            If you've read this far and you're wondering what I have to bring to the table still, let me say it up front.  It's clear that I have motivation, that I have drive.  Not only am I learning all these things to make myself more competitive, but I'm doing it myself.  I have nobody telling me to sit down and work 6 days a week, I do it out of my own passion.  I have passion for this field, I actually get excited when I see things that I think are amazing.  Not only am I passionate, but I'm a quick learner.  I have been coding for almost a year and a half, but I've been able to become proficient in many languages and understand many deep level concepts.  If a company told me to learn Ruby, for example, I guarantee that I would be able to become proficient in this language in a few weeks time.

            So the next question is, what exactly am I looking for.  I've said before that I am not sure what my desired field is, but there are things I would like to try.  The main one is a fullstack internship. My primary experience and knowledge is with backend programming, that combined with the fact that I know how to do front-end things such as make a website allows me to believe that this is a good route to check out both sides.  I would also enjoy an internship in the robotics field, I've always found myself fascinated with robotics and was in the Cal Poly Robotics club before the world shut down.  Internships in security, analytics, and other things also seem interesting to me as well, anything that will allow me to learn more.

            We've discussed my what I'm doing and what I want, but I haven't really gotten into who I am yet.  Disclaimer right here, I'm going to get more into my personal interests outside of computer science right now, so If that doesn't interest you feel free to stop.  I am Christian Bloemhof, I'm not just some student who goes to class, goes home, does homework, and sleeps. I have hobbies, tastes, and interests outside of programming and I'd love to take some time to talk about them.

            One thing that I always enjoy is sports.  I love watching sports, keeping up with headlines, and being physically active myself.  I'm not nearly as active as I was in high school, but I keep up.  In high school I was a tri-sport athlete, I did cross country, basketball, and track.  In college, I do some running on my own time and I go to the rec to play pick up with my friends.  Physical activity is a great way to relieve stress and give the mind a break.

            My whole life, I've always been social.  It's quite funny since I'm quite the introvert but I love to be going out with people.  I don't really care where it is, we could be sitting in your kitchen talking about life and that would be exactly where I want to be.  Although I do it quite often, I find it super often when I just do nothing with my evening.  It doesn't matter how tired I am, I want to make that effort to hang with friends and surround myself with those I care about.

            Another large part of my life is music.  I don't just mean listening to music, although I do love doing that, I mean playing music.  I've been playing piano ever since 4th grade, and in college I continue to play for myself and for my church.  I can also play saxophone, ukelele, guitar, drums, and maybe a few others that slip my mind but piano is my main thing.  I also really enjoy singing, but don't ask me to sing because I'm not very good at it.  I just believe that everyone should be unashamed to sing poorly because singing is incredibly fun.

            So this is a nice summary of who I am, but there is still so much more to learn about me.  I would love to share more of who I am and learn more about whoever is reading this.  Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read all of this, I know I can be quite long winded at times.  Feel free to reach out to me through email.
